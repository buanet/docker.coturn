## Docker networks

It is possible to run a turn server with bridged networking. You can find the requested ports and ranges [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/coturn/coturn).
As Docker performs badly with large port ranges using host network is recommended. This is already implemented in the following examples.

## Running from command-line

As all environment variables are optional you can simply run the latest image with this command:

`docker run -d --network=host buanet/coturn`

## Running with docker-compose



## Configuration

You can use the following environment variables to configure your container.

* `LISTENING_IP_ADDRESS` (optional, default: [listens on all]) set listening ip address
* `EXTERNAL_IP_ADDRESS` (optional, default: [autodetection]) set external ip address
* `TURN_PORT` (optional, default: 3478) Set a port
* `TURN_USERNAME` (optional, default: stunturn) Set a username
