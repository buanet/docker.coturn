This project uses "Coturn TURN server" (https://github.com/coturn/coturn) as base image and adds some useful implementations. 

## :question: What is a STUN/TURN server?

A STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT) server helps determine the public IP address and NAT type of a client that is behind a NAT (Network Address Translation). This is particularly useful for applications that require peer-to-peer communication, such as VoIP (Voice over IP) or video conferencing.

A TURN (Traversal Using Relays around NAT) server goes a step further by allowing data to be sent through a relay server when a direct peer-to-peer connection is not possible due to restrictive NATs or firewalls. TURN servers are therefore a more reliable solution for transmitting audio, video, and other real-time data.

This project uses the [Coturn TURN server](https://github.com/coturn/coturn) to provide a simple and effective implementation of STUN/TURN servers in Docker.

## :clipboard: Prerequisites

* A Docker enabled server - Get started with Docker at [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
  * recommended minimum resouces: 2 vCPU, 4GB RAM and 20GB Disk
* A public IP address assigned directly to the server or via a 1:1 NAT
* Portforwarding on these standard ports
  * 3478/TCP
  * 3478/UDP
  * 49152-65535/UDP

## :rocket: Get started

You will find all you need to know to run the image at the [Docker Hub page](https://hub.docker.com/r/buanet/coturn) or [here](https://github.com/buanet/docker.coturn/blob/main/docs/Docker_Hub_README.md).

## :memo: Changelog
